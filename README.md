# PIEEvaluationBot
This is particularly made for students who go to Phillips Exeter Academy, where we have to fill out PIEs, which is a time-taker. So, I gave some code to run that answers and submits for you. Basically, all you do is right click, go to inspect/inspect element, and then click on the console (it answers "Strongly Agree" for everything). Then copy and paste the code, click enter, and you are done! Do this for each PIE. 

# How to get Inspect Element 
Chrome: Enabled by default
Safari: Go to safari preferences --> click advanced --> click "show Develop".

Other browsers: Most likely similar steps, you need to get dev tools, which can be enabled in browser settings.
