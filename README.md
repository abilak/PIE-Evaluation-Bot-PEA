# PIEEvaluationBot
This is particularly made for students who go to Phillips Exeter Academy, where we have to fill out PIEs, which is a time-taker. So, I gave some code to run that answers and submits for you. Basically, all you do is right click, go to inspect/inspect element, and then click on the console. Then copy and paste the coded, and you are done! Do this for each PIE.
